&lt;size=20&gt;Progress Renderer (scheduled map renderings)&lt;/size&gt;

Automatically create scheduled renderings of the full map or only a chosen part of it. There are many options to configure the mod in the settings.

You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly. Rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory. For example you can use them to create an animated gif or video of your current run.

Place special corner marker designators to limit the area of what should be rendered. You can limit this to your base and even just simply extend it later if you base grows larger than planned.

Based on the idea of Map Renderer by WIT (https://github.com/AaronCRobinson/MapRenderer)
(Everything coded from scratch to work scheduled and with 1.0, which has the nice side effect of now being more performant and flexible.)
